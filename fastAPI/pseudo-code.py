"""
Assumptions:
1. The payments service is accessible via HTTP.
2. Basic error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented for robust communication.
3/ PostgreSQL is used as the database, but this can be swapped for SQLite if needed.

Handling Large Volumes and Concurrent Processing:
1. Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for decoupling services and ensuring reliable delivery.
2. Implement a distributed locking mechanism or idempotency keys to avoid duplicate processing.
3. This setup covers the requirements and provides a scalable, dockerized solution using FastAPI and SQLModel with PostgreSQL.
